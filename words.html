<h3> What Are Hotspots? </h3>
<p> Hotspots are places around the world with a significant amount of biodiversity.
There are animals and plants here that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.
At least 0.5% of the vascular plants living there must be endemics, which is a species
which is unique to a specific zone, habitat type, or area. These species are indigenous
to an area and cannot be found anywhere else.
In addition to this,
to qualify as a hotspot it must have lost at least 70% of its primary vegetarian living in the area due
to habitat loss or other causes. There are a total of 36 hotspots in the world. These hotspots
are the home of almost 60% of all the plants, birds, mammals, reptiles, and
amphibian species in the world. A very high share of these animals are also endemics.
Hotspots are irreplaceable places and most be protected in order to ensure the survival
of the species.
