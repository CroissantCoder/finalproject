Critically Endangered:
According to Encyclopedia Britannica, critically endangered species are defined as “species that possess an extremely high risk of extinction as a result of rapid population declines of 80 to more than 90 percent over the previous 10 years (or three generations), a current population size of fewer than 50 individuals, or other factors (such as severely fragmented populations, long generation times, or isolated habitats)”

The following is a selection of some of the critically endangered animals, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Since there are over 5000 species in this category, we have chosen not to show every species, however you can find this information through the ICUN Red List /insert link included here: https://www.iucnredlist.org/search?query=critically%20endangered&searchType=species
